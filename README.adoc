= Engine1
My first attempt at making a non-serious game engine +
If there are any issues with building/running please let me know

== Support
Windows and linux should both work

== Building
Ensure you have glfw installed system wide

. ``premake5 gmake2``
. ``make``

== TODO:
* [ ] Create a root engine struct
* [ ] Figure out if half my fixme "Hacks" can be fixed, or if I go to the classic programming moto
* [ ] Create a better error management system
** [ ] Optionals
* [ ] Make sure every function that works with pointers has null checks
** [x] asserts
* [ ] Add option for no custom color in render object (It could be hard coded by the shader)
* [ ] Logging
* [ ] Migrate default shaders to engine build file
* [ ] Add postbuild step for linux so that engine1 can be compiled staticly
** This can be done with ar
* [ ] Roll my own png reading library
* [ ] Move shaders that should be a part of engine to the engine
