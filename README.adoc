= Engine1
My first attempt at making a non-serious game engine +
If there are any issues with building/running please let me know

== Support
Currently I have only tested linux, so I got no clue about windows :) +
When I have the time to fix up my window dev environment I will test it out to ensure it works.

== Building
Ensure you have glfw installed system wide

. ``premake5 gmake2``
. ``make``

== TODO:
* [ ] Fix renderer to make it work better, currently very hacky (even for just a square?)
** Maybe create some sort of render object ecs?
* [ ] Create a root engine struct
* [ ] Do some compile time read hack on the shaders so the files actually matter
* [ ] Figure out if half my fixme "Hacks" can be fixed, or if I go to the classic programming moto
